# Welcome to Macro Athlete for Mobile

This is an sport specific, athlete based recovery AI specialist designed to aid with recovery for college athletes in season and off season.

## Motivation

As an ex college athlete I dealt with countless injuries that kept me out of competition throughout my 4 years playing soccer, from hamstrings to my knee, my back to minor injurys such as ankles and groins. After finishing my final season I sat down and really thought how could I have prevented some of these injuries - By taking more care of what I do when I'm not training or playing in a match. How can I optimize my recovery while I have such a packed training and match schedule cramed into 2 and half months.

## Tid bits

I first designed this project as a small mvp for my computer science senior thesis where I built out very basic functionalites that allowe athletes to provide a daily check in and input their weekly schedule and and AI would compile that data and give them recovery tip and metrics specific to them every day they checked in.


## Technologies

Originally I used Next Js for my front end and Nest Js for my backend combined with a postgres db where I stored inputs and data related to the athletes.

For this I plan to expand by adding a React Native front end so that users will be more inclined to use a phone app as to opposed to navigating to a website everyday where they might not as much access as their phones.


## How to use (user)

As a user navigate to either the webapp or the mobile app and proceed with signing up or logging in. If you are a new user you will go through a new user wizard to properly set up your account.
